# IT Seminar 2018 - Helsinki

## Schedule

**Monday** Denmark, and ice breaking event
 
**Tuesday** Finland
 
**Wednesday** company visits, starting with Fujitsu Finland in the morning, Symetri in the early afternoon, and possibly Arilyn in the late afternoon Symetri is a 3D scanning company and Arilyn is a VR marketing firm. if I can’t get Symetri or Arilyn, we could also start with a half day at the school first and then noon at Fujitsu.
 
**Thursday** Spain, and faculty dinner
 
**Friday** Switzerland
 
We have a classroom opposite to the 3D Lab so it’s pretty good.
 
Denmark and Finland will attempt a joint project with Danes doing a day on Arduino robots and Finns providing printing services for them. We’ve been thinking of a race or competition of sorts, but it’s still being discussed.
